# Duplicate String Counter

This is a function implementation that identifies all strings that appear more than once in a list and prints the string along with the number of occurrences.

---

## Why This Implementation?

### 1. **Clarity and simplicity**
- The solution is based on traditional approaches to data processing: using for-loops, HashMap and conditions.

### 2. **Flexibility to add additional logic**
- Since the logic is built on a loop, it is easy to add additional checks/conditions.

## Usage Example

### Input:
```java
List<String> input = Arrays.asList("dog", "cat", "dog", "monkey", "cat", "dog", "fox", null);
```

### Output:
```text
dog: 3
cat: 2
```
